step1:

create an array which stores the address of node


step 2:
store the address of head node in the array and move to next node

step 3:
if node is NULL then return 'NO',i.e there is no loop else,
store the address of node into the array and move to next node

step 4:
check whether the address of node is present in the array,
if 'YES' then there is a loop and return 'YES', else move to step 3.
